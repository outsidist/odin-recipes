    <h3 class="tagline">White rice, <em>how can so many people get it so wrong?</em></h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>80g uncooked white rice per portion</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>White vinegar or rice wine vinegar (<em>never</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Weigh out your rice</li>
        <li>Wash your rice by adding it to a saucepan, pouring in water and jostling it with your hand before pouring off the starchy water</li>
        <li>Do it 6 more times, literally, you can stop earlier if, and only if, the water you pour off is clear</li>
        <li>Add enough water so that the rice is covered by approx one knuckle. Put your finger in and poke the top of the rice, the water should go no higher than your first knuckle on your finger
            <br>Alternatively, you can try adding a ratio of 1.5ml of water:1g of rice, it is better to err on less than more!</li>
        <li>Put a lid on the rice, and place on a hob on a high heat</li>
        <li>As soon as the water begins simmering turn the temperature down to low</li>
        <li>Leave the rice to cook for 10 minutes, occasionally wiggling the pan to reduce the change of sticking</li>
        <li>After 10 minutes, leave the lid on and move the pan off the heat</li>
        <li>Wait 5-10 minutes, do not open. The steam will cause the rice to release itself from the bottom of the pan</li>
        <li>Take the lid off, using a rice spoon or fork fluff the rice up, adding a teaspoon or two of vinegar</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
